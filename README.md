Crono is a time-based background job scheduler daemon (just like Cron) for Ruby on Rails.


## The Purpose

Currently there is no such thing as Ruby Cron for Rails. Well, there's [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) but it works on top of Unix Cron, so you haven't control of it from Ruby. Crono is pure Ruby. It doesn't use Unix Cron and other platform-dependent things. So you can use it on all platforms supported by Ruby. It persists job states to your database using Active Record. You have full control of jobs performing process. It's Ruby, so you can understand and modify it to fit your needs.

## Requirements

Tested with latest MRI Ruby (2.2, 2.1 and 2.0) and Rails 3.2+  
Other versions are untested but might work fine.


## Installation

Add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'crono'
```

Run the `bundle` command to install it.  
After you install Crono, you can run the generator:

    rails generate crono:install

It will create a configuration file `config/cronotab.rb` and migration  
Run the migration:

    rake db:migrate

Now you are ready to move forward to create a job and schedule it.


## Usage

#### Create Job

Crono can use Active Job jobs from `app/jobs/`. The only requirements is that the `perform` method should take no arguments.

Here's an example of a job:

```ruby
# app/jobs/test_job.rb
class TestJob < ActiveJob::Base
  def perform
    # put you scheduled code here
    # Comments.deleted.clean_up...
  end
end
```

The ActiveJob jobs is convenient because you can use one job in both periodic and enqueued ways. But Active Job is not required. Any class can be used as a crono job if it implements a method `perform` without arguments:

```ruby
class TestJob # This is not an Active Job job, but pretty legal Crono job.
  def perform
    # put you scheduled code here
    # Comments.deleted.clean_up...
  end
end
```

Here's an example of a Rake Task within a job:

```ruby
# config/cronotab.rb
require 'rake'
# Be sure to change AppName to your application name!
AppName::Application.load_tasks

class Test
  def perform
    Rake::Task['crono:hello'].invoke
  end
end

Crono.perform(Test).every 5.seconds
```
With the rake task of:
```Ruby
#lib/tasks/test.rake
namespace :crono do
  desc 'Update all tables'
  task :hello => :environment do
    puts "hello"
  end
end
```

_Please note that crono uses threads, so your code should be thread-safe_

#### Job Schedule

Schedule list is defined in the file `config/cronotab.rb`, that created using `crono:install`. The semantic is pretty straightforward:

```ruby
# config/cronotab.rb
Crono.perform(TestJob).every 2.days, at: {hour: 15, min: 30}
Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.week, on: :monday, at: "15:30"
```

You can schedule one job a few times, if you want the job to be performed a few times a day or a week:

```ruby
Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.week, on: :monday
Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.week, on: :thursday
```

The `at` can be a Hash:

```ruby
Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.day, at: {hour: 12, min: 15}
```

#### Run daemon

To run Crono daemon, in your Rails project root directory:

    bundle exec crono RAILS_ENV=development

crono usage:
```
Usage: crono [options]
    -C, --cronotab PATH              Path to cronotab file (Default: config/cronotab.rb)
    -L, --logfile PATH               Path to writable logfile (Default: log/crono.log)
    -P, --pidfile PATH               Path to pidfile (Default: tmp/pids/crono.pid)
    -d, --[no-]daemonize             Daemonize process (Default: false)
    -e, --environment ENV            Application environment (Default: development)
```


## Web UI

Crono comes with a Sinatra application that can display the current state of Crono jobs.  
Add `sinatra` and `haml` to your Gemfile  

```ruby
gem 'haml'
gem 'sinatra', require: nil
```

Add the following to your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
    mount Crono::Web, at: '/crono'
    ...
```
